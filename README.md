## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation means a website still works even if some advanced features aren't supported. Service workers help by managing network requests, allowing offline use, and caching resources. If a browser doesn't support service workers, the site still functions. This way, users with older browsers still get a working website, while those with newer browsers get extra features.
